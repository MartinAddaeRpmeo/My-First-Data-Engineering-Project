# Simple ETL Pipeline with Python
This project is a beginner-friendly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built in Python. It was developed as part of the IBM Data Engineering Course on Coursera and is my first official project as a junior data engineer.

## Project Overview
The pipeline performs the following steps:
Extracts data from multiple file formats: CSV, JSON, and XML
Transforms the data by converting units and cleaning it
Loads the final dataset into:
A local CSV file
A SQLite3 database
Additionally, a log file is created to record each phase of the process.

## ETL Architecture

## Features
### Extracts from three different formats (CSV, JSON, XML)

### Transforms the data (e.g., inches → meters, pounds → kilograms)

### Loads into:
CSV file (Transformed_csv.csv)
SQLite3 database (my_db.db)

 Logs all operations into a file (logging_file.txt)

Simple modular functions and clear structure

## Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
xml.etree.ElementTree
SQLite3
glob
datetime

## What I Have Learned So Far
This project helped me build a strong foundation in Data Engineering and Python Scripting. Here’s a breakdown of the skills and tools I practiced:

Python Programming
Data Extraction
Data Transformation
Data Loading
File Handling & Automation

## Acknowledgment
Thanks to IBM and Coursera for the training opportunity. This project was inspired by their hands-on exercises and guided labs.
