## Simple ETL Pipeline with Python
This project is a beginner-friendly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built in Python. It was developed as part of the IBM Data Engineering Course on Coursera and is my first official project as a junior data engineer.

# Project Overview
The pipeline performs the following steps:
Extracts data from multiple file formats: CSV, JSON, and XML
Transforms the data by converting units and cleaning it
Loads the final dataset into:
A local CSV file
A SQLite3 database
Additionally, a log file is created to record each phase of the process.
